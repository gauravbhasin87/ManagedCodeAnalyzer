  What's Changed in New Parser?
  =============================
  1. New Version of Toker.cs
     - Returning Comments now optional and set to false by default
     - fixed tokenizing the new style strings @"..."

  2. Added some comments to Semi.cs

  To use this new stuff you don't have to start over.  Just copy
  Toker.cs and Semi.cs into all your projects that use them.
